## Project Automation Rule

This project follows a strict automation rule:

1. A Git repository is initialized from the beginning.
2. After each successful development step or test run, code is committed to Git with a meaningful commit message.
3. This rule ensures that every working state is version-controlled and recoverable.
4. No local changes should remain uncommitted before starting the next development iteration.

### Example Commit Messages:
- feat: added file upload interface
- chore: updated Gemini API call for sentiment classification
- fix: resolved bug in visualization rendering
- refactor: cleaned up component logic
- docs: added sentiment analysis instructions
